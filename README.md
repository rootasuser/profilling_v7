Responsive Dashboard with Vanilla JS, CSS, and Bootstrap 5

Welcome to my project! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a fully responsive dashboard designed with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, built to provide a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices. I developed this dashboard to showcase my skills in front-end development, creating a user-friendly interface, and integrating responsiveness for an enhanced user experience.

Key Features:

Fully Responsive Design: The dashboard adapts perfectly to both mobile and desktop screens, ensuring users get an optimal experience no matter their device.
Bootstrap 5 Integration: I've utilized the power of Bootstrap 5 for a clean and modern UI, making the design both flexible and attractive.
Vanilla JavaScript: I implemented key interactivity using plain JavaScript to keep the project lightweight and efficient, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks (except for Bootstrap).
Dynamic Elements: With vanilla JS, I've added functionality like collapsible sidebars, dropdown menus, and real-time user interaction features.
Why This Project?
This project is a testament to my ability to create responsive web applications from the ground up with the latest web technologies. My goal was to develop a dashboard that is intuitive to use, yet powerful enough to manage user data, provide quick access to settings, and deliver a professional-looking user interface.
